# GIPHY

Dynamic gif generator made using GIPHY API.
  
  1. User can click on each button at top of page to generate catalog of 10 images, each rated with various rating system.
  2. Once gif have been generated, user can click to play and pause.
  3. User can add their own buttons to generator.
  
Need to fix:
  When user clicks enter, the reference word is turned into a button, but does not populate any gif results.
